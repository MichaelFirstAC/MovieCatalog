# Movie Recommender and Catalog System

## Introduction

This project is a web-based movie recommendation application developed as a final project for the Fundamentals of Data Science. It addresses the "choice overload" and "cold-start" problems common in streaming platforms by providing intelligent, content-based suggestions without requiring user history.

The system utilizes a **hybrid approach**:
1.  **Weighted Content-Based Filtering:** Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to find semantically similar movies, with higher weights assigned to **Directors** and **Cast** to capture "auteur" style and star power.
2.  **Bayesian Quality Scoring:** Implements the IMDb weighted rating formula to ensure that recommended movies are statistically high-quality, balancing raw ratings with vote counts.

## Key Features

* ** Content-Based Recommender:** Suggests movies based on a "Weighted Soup" of metadata (Director x3, Cast x2, Keywords x1, Genres x1).
* ** Browse by Star:** Search for movies featuring specific Actors or Directors. Includes a "Cold Start" fix that suggests popular stars if the search is empty.
* ** Surprise Me!:** A discovery feature that randomly selects a high-quality movie from the top-rated 500 films.
* ** Smart Catalog:** A full, paginated library of over 4,800 movies, filterable by Genre and sorted by Bayesian Quality Score.
* ** Interactive Metadata:** All Directors, Cast members, and Genres are clickable, allowing seamless navigation to related content.
* ** Modern UI:** A responsive, dark-themed interface built with Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x (This program is made in 3.14, but any version of 3.x python should work.)
- The `pip` package manager

### Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone [https://github.com/MichaelFirstAC/MovieCatalog.git](https://github.com/MichaelFirstAC/MovieCatalog.git)
cd MovieCatalog
```
2. Install Dependencies Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn
```
3. Prepare the Data and Model (One-Time Setup)

The application requires the raw CSV files (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`) to be present in the root directory.
- Note: If these files are zipped (`archive.zip`), please extract them into the root folder first.

Run the `prepare_model.py` script. This script will:
- Clean and parse the JSON datasets.
- Calculate the Bayesian Quality Score for every movie.
- Build the TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity matrices.
- Save the processed models (movies.pkl and cosine_sim.pkl).

```
python prepare_model.py
```

4. Run the Web Application Once the model files are generated, start the Flask server:

```
python app.py
```
You should see output indicating the server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

5. Access the Application Open your web browser and navigate to:

[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

### Project Structure
- app.py: The main Flask application containing routing logic and the recommendation engine.
- prepare_model.py: The data pipeline script for cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- templates/index.html: The unified frontend template handling all views (Home, Catalog, Browse, etc.).
- static/: Contains CSS assets and team images.
- movies.pkl & cosine_sim.pkl: Serialized model files generated by the preparation script.
